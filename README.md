# github-followers

# Description of the problem
Built using Meteor and React, this application allows a user to enter the name of a Github user and retrieve that user's followers.

# Technical choices | trade-offs
I built the app using Meteor and React because I have been trying to learn about both of these technologies, having not really used them before, and how React in particular has become a very popular tool.

# Notes about the code
I have the main functionality working the way I would like, but I would like to dive further into the "best practices" for React, and to get some test coverage.
